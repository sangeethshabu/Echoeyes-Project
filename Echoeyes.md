# Echoeyes-Project

Group 5 of S8 CSE B(2021-2025 Batch) has made this project

This project marks a meaningful milestone in leveraging technology to overcome communication barriers for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. By seamlessly integrating a mobile app with advanced speech-to-text technology, an ESP32 microcontroller, and a mini OLED display, the system provides real-time subtitles that empower users to actively engage in conversations with greater independence and ease. The device captures audio through the phoneâ€™s microphone, converts it into text using speech recognition software, and wirelessly transmits it to the ESP32 for formatting and display. This process allows for real-time accessibility that supports social and professional interactions alike.
The project has demonstrated a user-friendly design that prioritizes portability, with the lightweight and compact system ensuring convenience for daily use. Extensive testing has highlighted its ability to perform efficiently in controlled environments, delivering minimal latency and high accuracy. However, the project also reveals areas for refinement, such as enhancing noise filtering for better performance in dynamic and noisy environments, improving battery life for prolonged use, and addressing occasional connectivity delays in certain scenarios.
This innovation underscores the importance of creating inclusive technology that empowers and uplifts marginalized communities. By removing communication barriers, the device fosters a sense of equality and belonging, allowing individuals to participate fully in conversations without relying on external support. Moving forward, the project opens pathways for further advancements, such as integrating features like multi-language support, expanded customization options, and augmented reality for immersive experiences. These enhancements will help refine the system to meet broader needs, paving the way for a more inclusive and connected society where technology bridges gaps and brings people together.
